# Cell 6 is commented out because it was turning the "cleaned_df" into a method that could not be used for the rest of the analysis. When I tried assigning a different variable to the code I got lots of errors, but the current code functions properly.

# I also used the .nunique function in cell 4 so the total from the cleaned data frame does not need to be different before and after cleaning.

# The box and whisker plot was created with the help of Justin the tutor, the X-pert AI, and class activities.
